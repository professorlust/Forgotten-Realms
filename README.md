# Forgotten Realms RPG

This is a text-based role-playing game written in Python 3.6 that I am currently working on. It's going to use the Dungeons and Dragons 3.5e ruleset and will be set in the Forgotten Realms setting (hence the title of this project).

Other than the above, I have no clue what I'm going to do with this project - at least in the immediate future. My end goal for the game is to have it be an open world, text-based RPG that covers all of Faerun (or even Toril as a whole).

## Dependencies

* colorama
* dice

To install these packages, just type "pip install colorama dice" in your computer's command prompt/terminal before running the game.
