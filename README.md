# Forgotten Realms RPG

This is a text-based role-playing game that I am currently working on. It's going to use the Dungeons and Dragons 3.5e ruleset and will be set in the Forgotten Realms setting (hence the title of this project).

Other than the above, I have no clue what I'm going to do with this project.
